# Dual Alternating Minimization (DAM) for solving the Total Variation (TV) denoising problem
This repository contains a MatLab implementation of the Dual Alternating Minimization (DAM) for solving the Total Variation (TV) denoising problem.

The precise definition of the problem and the description of the algorithm can be found in the paper:
A. Beck, L. Tetruashvili, Y. Vaisbourd, A. Shemtov, [Rate of convergence analysis of dual-based variables decomposition methods for strongly convex problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637715001534), Operations Research Letters, 44(1) (2016), 61-66.
